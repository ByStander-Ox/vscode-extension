## ‚ú® What's new 

**üåé Open Source**
The extension is now open source and you can review and contribute to its development.

**‚úçÔ∏è Chat and comments**
People can now add comments to your coding sessions and you can chat with anyone that visits your coding sessions. 

**üõé Mute notifications**
Now we are enabling Do not disturb automatically once you start recording. This will prevent notifications to pop on your screen.

We solved several bugs and improved performance. E.g. Custom theme being changed, Windows cropped recordings.
